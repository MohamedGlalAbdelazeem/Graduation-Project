# Gold Price Forecasting App

Welcome to the Gold Price Forecasting App repository! This project is developed as a part of our graduation project and leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to forecast gold prices.

## Project Overview

The Gold Price Forecasting App is designed to predict future gold prices based on historical data and various economic indicators. The app uses machine learning algorithms to analyze trends and patterns in the data, providing users with accurate and reliable price forecasts.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Aggregates historical gold price data and economic indicators from multiple sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning models such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM to train on the historical data.
- **Prediction**: Provides future gold price predictions based on the trained models.
- **Visualization**: Includes interactive charts and graphs to visualize historical data and predictions.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface to input data, view predictions, and interact with the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework**: Flask or Django
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git
